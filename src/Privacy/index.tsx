            <p style={{fontWeight:`bold`}}>7. Security</p>

            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
            will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal

            and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. The personal data will be
            destroyed if it is no longer required for the lawful purpose(s) for which it was obtained.</p>

            <p style={{fontWeight: `bold`}}>9. Your rights</p>
            <p>You have the following rights in relation to your personal data:</p>

            <p>If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can
            withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
            processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal
            information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent;</p>
            <p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your
