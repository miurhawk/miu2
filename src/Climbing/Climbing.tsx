            <h1>climbing : {'{'} life {'}'}</h1>
            <h3 id="history">history + achievements</h3>
            <p>I have been climbing since I was 6 years old. I have represented the united states internationally in IFSC world cups and world championships in all three disciplines of lead, speed, and bouldering.</p>
            <p>as a coach I have also led athletes to national and international competition. i love to help motivated athletes improve themselves.</p>
            <p>in the past few years I have transitioned from primarily climbing indoors to climbing almost exclusively on rock. while this was not entirely by choice, it has been a welcome change in my life.</p>
            <p>here are some of my climbing-related achievements of which I am proud:
            <ul>
                <li>2019: FA Superwoman 8b - mistra, Malta</li>
                <li>2016: ascent of mount rainier disappointment cleaver - wa, USA</li>
                <li>2014: ifsc bouldering world cup circuit - baku, laval, innsbruck, grindelwald</li>
                <li>2010: USA climbing FJR lead national champion</li>
                <li>2007: first youth world championships - ibarra, ecuador</li>
                <li>2003: first us national climbing competition - alexandria, va</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="resources">resources</h3>
            <p>here are some of my favorite climbing and training resources:

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://udini.com/">Udo Neumann</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://trainingforclimbing.com/">Training for climbing</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickonhands/">Nick Brewer</a></li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><span style={{fontWeight: `bold`}}>my personal philosophy</span> in coaching and training centers heavily around motivation and recovery cycles. we must be strict with ourselves to see short-term gain, but we must be kind to ourselves for sustainable gain. if you are able to generate motivation for achieving your goals, you <span style={{fontStyle: `italic`, fontWeight: `bold`}}>will</span> find some form of success.</p>

            <p>I like to think of training cycles as seasons that culminate in a goal-related event. each season should include a ramp-up, a high-intensity moment ("the championship"), and a recovery and retrospective period where you set your goals and plan for the next season. cross-training and injury prevention need to coexist with sport-specific training throughout the entire season.</p>

            <p><span style={{fontWeight: `bold`}}>ten tips for success: </span>
                <ol>
                <li>Strength is useless without range of motion</li>
                <li>Technique {'>'} Nutrition {'>'} Flexibility {'>'} Strength</li>
                <li>Do not cut corners</li>
                <li>The body is slave to the mind</li>
                <li>Rest is as important as work</li>
                <li>Listen to your body, understand good pain vs bad pain</li>
                <li>The golden hour of nutrition follows training</li>
                <li>You are what you eat</li>
                <li>Have a fallback "easy" activity for when motivation is low</li>
                <li>You are only as good as your weakest area</li>
            </ol></p>
