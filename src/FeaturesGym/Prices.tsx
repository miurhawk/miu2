          We allow climbers to create a <span style={{fontWeight: `bold`}}>single universal profile</span> that's used by all gyms using our system. That means <span style={{fontWeight: `bold`}}>faster onboarding for new clients, and less work for your front desk employees</span>. BETA manages waivers, passes, point of sale, and event bookings, and allows quick linking to a customer's profile for <span style={{fontWeight: `bold`}}>check-in or purchases through QR codes</span> generated in our mobile app.
